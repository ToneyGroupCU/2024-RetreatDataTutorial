    "> \"NumPy (short for Numerical Python) provides an efficient interface to store and operate on dense data buffers. In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python's built-in list type, but NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size. NumPy arrays form the core of nearly the entire ecosystem of data science tools in Python, so time spent learning to use NumPy effectively will be valuable no matter what aspect of data science interests you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via gnuplot from the IPython command line. IPython's creator, Fernando Perez, was at the time scrambling to finish his PhD, and let John know he wouldn’t have time to review the patch for several months. John took this as a cue to set out on his own, and the Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1 released in 2003.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Pandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a DataFrame. DataFrames are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data. As well as offering a convenient storage interface for labeled data, Pandas implements a number of powerful data operations familiar to users of both database frameworks and spreadsheet programs.\""

    "\n",
    "1. **Creating/Installing Rclone in a Conda Environment:**\n",
    "   - **Create a New Conda Environment:**\n",
    "     If you do not have an environment named 'rclone', create it using:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda create -n rclone python=3.11\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Activate the environment:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda activate rclone\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Install Rclone in an Existing or New Conda Environment:**\n",
    "     Activate your environment:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda activate yourenvironmentname\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Within the 'rclone' environment, install Rclone using:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda install -c conda-forge rclone\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configure Rclone with OneDrive:**\n",
    "   - Open a terminal and activate the 'rclone' environment:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda activate rclone\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Start the Rclone configuration process:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     rclone config\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Follow these steps in the interactive setup:\n",
    "     - **n** - New remote.\n",
    "     - **Name** - Enter whatever you want for the name of your remote, I use `onedrive` as the name of my OneDrive remote.\n",
    "     - **Storage Type** - Scroll through the options and select the number corresponding to `Microsoft OneDrive`.\n",
    "     - **client_id** - Leave blank (just press Enter).\n",
    "     - **client_secret** - Leave blank (just press Enter).\n",
    "     - **region** - Choose the region closest to you or leave it as the default.\n",
    "     - **token** - Rclone will provide a link. Open this link in your web browser, log in to your Microsoft account, and grant access. Copy the token provided into the terminal.\n",
    "     - **drive_id** - Leave blank for a personal account, or fill it in if you have a specific drive ID for business/education accounts.\n",
    "     - **drive_type** - Choose the appropriate type (personal, business, or education).\n",
    "     - **Edit advanced config** - Usually, No is fine unless you need specific advanced settings.\n",
    "     - **Use auto config** - Choose Yes if you are running on a local machine. For remote setups like a server or headless system, choose No and follow the instructions to authenticate using a local machine.\n",
    "     - **Configure as a team drive** - Choose No for a personal OneDrive account.\n",
    "     - Finally, **Yes** to confirm the settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing the Configuration:**\n",
    "   - To ensure that the setup was successful, list the directories in your OneDrive:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     rclone lsd onedrive:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - You should see a list of the folders in your OneDrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat the Process on NSLS-II JupyterHub Server:**\n",
    "   - Repeat the above steps to configure Rclone with OneDrive on the NSLS-II JupyterHub server.\n",
    "   - Make sure to use the same 'onedrive' remote configuration to ensure seamless synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transferring Files:**\n",
    "   - Use `rclone copy`, `rclone sync`, or other Rclone commands to transfer files between your local machine, OneDrive, and the JupyterHub server.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these detailed steps, you can set up Rclone to work with OneDrive both on your local machine and on remote servers like NSLS-II JupyterHub. This allows for efficient management and synchronization of your data across different platforms."

    "Dask Arrays are used to parallel computing applications, and are analogous to NumPy arrays in regards to available operations.
